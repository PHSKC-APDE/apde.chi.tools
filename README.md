## Best Practices

If you have code that uses these functions from last year, you will want to confirm that the function contained in this package conforms to the expectations of the previous version. You can review the manual for any function by typing '?[function_name]()'. There you will see the expected parameters and examples of usage. If these are insufficient, please reach out!
