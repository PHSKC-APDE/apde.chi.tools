\usage{
chi_chars_injury(
  ph.indicator = NA,
  ph.data = NULL,
  myinstructions = NULL,
  chars.defs = NULL,
  def = "narrow"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ph.indicator}{A character string of length 1. The indicator key to process,
which must exist in the chars.defs data table.}

\item{ph.data}{A data.table containing the CHARS data to be processed.}

\item{myinstructions}{A data.table containing processing instructions for each indicator.
Default is the output from \code{\link{chi_generate_tro_shell}}.}

\item{chars.defs}{A data.table containing definitions for each indicator. It
should have the following columns: \code{indicator_name}, \code{indicator_key}, \code{intent},
\code{mechanism}, \code{age_start}, and \code{age_end}.}

\item{def}{A character string indicating which injury definition to use.
Default is \code{def = 'narrow'}.}
}
\value{
Returns a data.table containing the summarized CHARS injury hospitalization
data for the specified indicator_key, stratified by the requested demographic
variables:
 \itemize{
   \item \code{indicator_key}: Injury type identifier
   \item \code{year}: Year range of data (e.g., "2019-2021", "2023", etc.)
   \item \code{chi_age}: Age value (0-100)
   \item \code{hospitalizations}: Number of injury hospitalizations for that
   indicator_key x demographic x age group
   \item \code{tab}: Visualization tab type (e.g., "_kingcounty", "demgroups",
   etc.)
   \item \code{cat1}, \code{cat1_varname}, \code{cat1_group}: Primary
   stratification variable details
   \item \code{cat2}, \code{cat2_varname}, \code{cat2_group}: Secondary
   stratification variable details (if applicable)
 }
}
\description{
Generate hospitalization age-specific counts from Comprehensive Hospital
Abstract Reporting System (CHARS) data for injury indicators including falls,
poisoning, self-harm, and other injury mechanisms for CHI. This function
processes instructions for specific indicators and summarizes CHARS data
accordingly.
}
\details{
Note that injury data is only available for 2012 and later years. Unlike
\code{\link{chi_chars_ccs}}, this function doesn't need to handle the ICD-9
to ICD-10 transition explicitly since the mechanism and intent columns have
been standardized across coding systems. Results will returned stratified by
age to perform age-standardization.
